# RemCalc

This IIFE allows you to add floating font sizing logic to documentElement based on screen size. When the screen width changes, font sizes are recalculated and written to the root element by the inline style. Using rem change units in scc this allows you to get responsive font sizes throughout the application.

## How to use

1) Add the remcalc.js file to your application.
2) Connect it to HTML via script tag:
```html
 <script src="URL_TO_FILE/remcalc.js"></script>
```
3) Use relative rem font sizes in css where responsiveness is needed
